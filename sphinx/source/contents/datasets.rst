    :width: 750

**Dataset1** relies on simulated time data from which the features are extracted and has been used in the following 
publications: :cite:`Kujawski2019`, :cite:`Kujawski2022`, :cite:`Feng2022`.

**Dataset2** relies on analytically or sampled auto- and cross-power spectra of the microphones.
